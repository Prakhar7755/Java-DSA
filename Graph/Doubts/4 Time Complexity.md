Graphs can be implemented using various data structures, each with its own time and space complexities. Here are some common graph implementations and their associated complexities:

1. Adjacency Matrix:

   - Time Complexity:
     - Checking if two vertices are adjacent: O(1)
     - Finding all neighbors of a vertex: O(|V|)
   - Space Complexity: O(|V|^2), where |V| is the number of vertices

2. Adjacency List:

   - Time Complexity:
     - Checking if two vertices are adjacent: O(degree(V))
     - Finding all neighbors of a vertex: O(degree(V))
   - Space Complexity: O(|V| + |E|), where |V| is the number of vertices and |E| is the number of edges

3. Edge List:

   - Time Complexity:
     - Checking if two vertices are adjacent: O(|E|)
     - Finding all neighbors of a vertex: O(|E|)
   - Space Complexity: O(|E|), where |E| is the number of edges

4. Incidence Matrix:

   - Time Complexity:
     - Checking if two vertices are adjacent: O(|V| \* |E|)
     - Finding all neighbors of a vertex: O(|V| \* |E|)
   - Space Complexity: O(|V| \* |E|), where |V| is the number of vertices and |E| is the number of edges

5. Hybrid Approaches:
   - Hybrid approaches combine multiple data structures to achieve a balance between time and space complexities. The specific complexities depend on the combination of data structures used.

It's important to note that these complexities are generalizations and can vary based on the specific implementation details and the operations performed on the graph. Additionally, some implementations may be more suitable for certain types of operations or graphs than others.
