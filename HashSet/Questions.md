Sure, here are 20 Java programs related to HashSet:

1. **Basic HashSet Operations:**

   - Implement a Java program that demonstrates basic operations like adding elements, removing elements, and checking for membership in a HashSet.

2. **Duplicate Removal Using HashSet:**

   - Write a Java program that takes an array as input and removes duplicate elements from it using a HashSet.

3. **Intersection of Two Sets:**

   - Create a Java program that finds the intersection of two sets using HashSet.

4. **Union of Two Sets:**

   - Write a Java program to find the union of two sets using HashSet.

5. **Symmetric Difference of Two Sets:**

   - Implement a Java program to find the symmetric difference of two sets using HashSet.

6. **Subset Check Using HashSet:**

   - Develop a Java program that checks if one set is a subset of another using HashSet.

7. **Set Equality Check Using HashSet:**

   - Write a Java program to check if two sets are equal using HashSet.

8. **HashSet Serialization and Deserialization:**

   - Create a Java program to serialize a HashSet to a file and then deserialize it back.

9. **HashSet Operations Without Built-in Methods:**

   - Implement Java methods for set operations (union, intersection, difference) without using built-in HashSet methods.

10. **HashSet vs. TreeSet Performance Comparison:**

    - Write a Java program to compare the performance of HashSet and TreeSet for various operations like adding, removing, and searching elements.

11. **HashSet of Custom Objects:**

    - Create a Java program that uses HashSet to store and manage a collection of custom objects, ensuring uniqueness based on custom-defined equality criteria.

12. **Converting HashSet to Array:**

    - Write a Java program that converts a HashSet to an array and vice versa.

13. **Removing Specific Elements from HashSet:**

    - Implement a Java program that removes specific elements from a HashSet based on certain conditions.

14. **Finding Maximum and Minimum Element in HashSet:**

    - Develop a Java program to find the maximum and minimum elements in a HashSet.

15. **Removing All Elements Except Specified Ones:**

    - Write a Java program that removes all elements from a HashSet except those specified in another set.

16. **Checking Disjoint Sets:**

    - Create a Java program to check if two sets are disjoint (i.e., they have no common elements) using HashSet.

17. **HashSet Iterator Usage:**

    - Implement a Java program that demonstrates the usage of iterators with HashSet.

18. **HashSet Synchronization:**

    - Write a Java program to demonstrate synchronization of HashSet in a multi-threaded environment.

19. **Counting Occurrences of Elements in HashSet:**

    - Develop a Java program to count the occurrences of each element in a HashSet.

20. **HashSet Clearing and Cloning:**
    - Create a Java program that clears a HashSet and clones it to another HashSet.

These programs cover various aspects of HashSet usage in Java and can help deepen your understanding of its functionality and versatility.
