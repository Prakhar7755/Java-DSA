The difference between these two lines of code is in the type of reference:

```java
Map<String, Number> hm1 = new HashMap<>();
HashMap<String, Number> hm2 = new HashMap<>();
```

- `Map<String, Number> hm1 = new HashMap<>();` Here, `hm1` is a reference of type `Map` which is an interface, and it's pointing to an object of `HashMap`, which is a class that implements the `Map` interface. This is a common practice in Java known as **programming to an interface not implementation**. It means that the code is dependent on the `Map` interface, not the `HashMap` implementation, making the code more flexible for future changes (like changing `HashMap` to `TreeMap`).

- `HashMap<String, Number> hm2 = new HashMap<>();` Here, `hm2` is a reference of type `HashMap`. This means it can access all methods provided by `HashMap` class, including those that are not in the `Map` interface.

In general, unless you need to use methods specific to `HashMap`, it's more flexible to use `Map<String, Number> hm1 = new HashMap<>();`. This way, if you decide to change from `HashMap` to another implementation of `Map` like `TreeMap` or `LinkedHashMap`, you won't need to change the rest of your code. It's a good practice to keep your code as flexible and change-tolerant as possible.

You should decide between `Map<String, Number> hm = new HashMap<>();` and `HashMap<String, Number> hm = new HashMap<>();` based on your specific needs:

- **Use `Map<String, Number> hm = new HashMap<>();` when you want more flexibility:**

  - If you're writing code that will be used in many places or by other people, and you want to ensure that they can use any class that implements the `Map` interface.
  - If you think you might want to change the `HashMap` to another type of `Map` in the future (like a `TreeMap` or `LinkedHashMap`), using `Map` makes it easier to make this change.

- **Use `HashMap<String, Number> hm = new HashMap<>();` when you need features specific to `HashMap`:**
  - If you need to use methods that are unique to `HashMap` and not part of the `Map` interface.
  - If you're sure that you won't need to change the `HashMap` to another type of `Map` in the future.

Remember, it's generally a good practice to program to an interface, not an implementation. This means that unless you have a good reason to use `HashMap` specifically, you should probably use `Map`. This makes your code more flexible and adaptable to changes.
