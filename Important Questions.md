Certainly! Here is a comprehensive list of programs related to stacks in Java that cover various data structures and algorithms concepts:

1. Stack Implementation: Implement a stack data structure in Java, including operations like push, pop, and isEmpty.

2. Balanced Parentheses: Check whether a given string of parentheses is balanced or not using a stack.

3. Reverse a String: Reverse a string using a stack.

4. Infix to Postfix Conversion: Convert an infix expression to postfix expression using a stack.

5. Evaluate Postfix Expression: Evaluate a postfix expression using a stack.

6. Next Greater Element: Find the next greater element for each element in an array using a stack.

7. Stock Span Problem: Solve the stock span problem using a stack.

8. Infix to Prefix Conversion: Convert an infix expression to prefix expression using a stack.

9. Implement Two Stacks in an Array: Implement two stacks in a single array efficiently.

10. Check for Redundant Parentheses: Check if there are redundant parentheses in an expression using a stack.

11. Implement a Min Stack: Implement a stack that supports the min() operation in constant time.

12. Implement a Max Stack: Implement a stack that supports the max() operation in constant time.

13. Reverse a Stack: Reverse the order of elements in a stack using only one additional stack.

14. Implement a Stack using Queues: Implement a stack using two queues.

15. Check for Balanced Symbols: Check whether a given string containing symbols is balanced using a stack.

16. Evaluate Prefix Expression: Evaluate a prefix expression using a stack.

17. Implement a Stack using Linked List: Implement a stack data structure using a linked list.

18. Next Smaller Element: Find the next smaller element for each element in an array using a stack.

19. Implement a Stack using Arrays: Implement a stack data structure using an array.

20. Check for Duplicate Parentheses: Check if there are duplicate parentheses in an expression using a stack.

These programs cover a wide range of topics related to stacks and can help you practice various data structures and algorithms concepts. By implementing and understanding these programs, you'll gain a solid foundation in stack-related problems and their solutions.
