Sure, I'd be happy to explain polymorphism in Java!

**Polymorphism** is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), the others being inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction. The term "polymorphism" comes from the Greek words "poly" (many) and "morph" (forms), and it refers to the ability of a single entity to take on many forms.

In Java, polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways. It provides the following features:
1. It allows us to perform a single action by different ways.
2. It provides code reusability.
3. It is used to achieve loose coupling.

There are two types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism. We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding.

Here are some examples:

**Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading):**
```java
class Adder {
    static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    static int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }
}

public class TestOverloading {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Adder.add(11, 11));
        System.out.println(Adder.add(11, 11, 11));
    }
}
```
In this example, we have two `add` methods in the `Adder` class that perform addition. The first adds two integers, while the second adds three. This is an example of compile-time polymorphism because the method to be invoked is determined at compile time.

**Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding):**
```java
class Vehicle {
    void run() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle is running");
    }
}

class Bike extends Vehicle {
    void run() {
        System.out.println("Bike is running safely");
    }
}

public class TestOverriding {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle v = new Bike(); // creating instance of parent class
        v.run(); // calling method by child class instance
    }
}
```
In this example, the `Bike` class overrides the `run` method of the `Vehicle` class. This is an example of runtime polymorphism because the method to be invoked is determined at runtime.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. ðŸ˜Š
