Certainly! Let's delve into the **abstract keyword** in Java, its properties, and some examples.

1. **Abstract Keyword Overview**:
   - The `abstract` keyword is a **non-access modifier** used to achieve **abstraction** in Java.
   - It is primarily used to create **abstract classes** and **abstract methods**.
   - An abstract class serves as a blueprint for other classes and can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods.
   - Abstract methods are declared using the `abstract` keyword and do not have an implementation; they must be overridden by concrete (non-abstract) subclasses.

2. **Rules and Usage**:
   - **Don'ts**:
     - You **cannot** use the `abstract` keyword with variables or constructors.
     - An abstract class **cannot** be instantiated directly (i.e., you cannot create objects of abstract classes).
     - Abstract methods **do not** contain a body (implementation).
     - The `abstract` keyword **cannot** be combined with `final`.
     - Abstract methods **cannot** be declared as `private` or `static`.
     - An abstract method **cannot** be synchronized.
   - **Do's**:
     - The `abstract` keyword can only be used with classes and methods.
     - An abstract class can contain constructors and static methods.
     - If a class extends an abstract class, it must implement at least one of the abstract methods.
     - An abstract class can contain the `main` method and final methods.
     - Overloaded abstract methods are allowed.
     - Local inner classes can be declared as abstract.
     - Abstract methods can have a `throws` clause.

3. **Examples**:

   - **Example 1: Abstract Class with an Abstract Method**:
     ```java
     abstract class Vehicle {
         abstract void bike();
     }

     class Honda extends Vehicle {
         @Override
         void bike() {
             System.out.println("Bike is running");
         }
     }

     public class AbstractExample1 {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             Honda obj = new Honda();
             obj.bike();
         }
     }
     ```
     Output:
     ```
     Bike is running
     ```

   - **Example 2: Abstract Class with Abstract and Non-Abstract Methods**:
     ```java
     abstract class Vehicle {
         abstract void bike();

         void car() {
             System.out.println("Car is running");
         }
     }

     class Honda extends Vehicle {
         @Override
         void bike() {
             System.out.println("Bike is running");
         }
     }

     public class AbstractExample2 {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             Honda obj = new Honda();
             obj.bike();
             obj.car();
         }
     }
     ```
     Output:
     ```
     Bike is running
     Car is running
     ```

   - **Example 3: Abstract Class with a Constructor**:
     ```java
     abstract class Vehicle {
         String msg;

         Vehicle(String msg) {
             this.msg = msg;
         }

         void display() {
             System.out.println(msg);
         }
     }

     class Honda extends Vehicle {
         Honda(String msg) {
             super(msg);
         }
     }

     public class AbstractExample3 {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             Honda obj = new Honda("Constructor is invoked");
             obj.display();
         }
     }
     ```
     Output:
     ```
     Constructor is invoked
     ```

   - **Example 4: Abstract Class with Overloaded Abstract Methods**:
     ```java
     abstract class Vehicle {
         abstract void display();

         abstract void display(String msg);
     }

     class Honda extends Vehicle {
         @Override
         void display() {
             System.out.println("Abstract method is invoked");
         }

         @Override
         void display(String msg) {
             System.out.println(msg);
         }
     }

     public class AbstractExample4 {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             Honda obj = new Honda();
             obj.display();
             obj.display("Custom message");
         }
     }
     ```
     Output:
     ```
     Abstract method is invoked
     Custom message
     ```
   
   These examples demonstrate the usage of the `abstract` keyword in creating abstract classes and methods. Remember that abstract classes provide a foundation for more specialized classes to build upon, promoting better design and code organization¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥.
